# Databases
Thermodynamic databases for use with the Theriak-Domino suite of programs.

## Usage
Please review each file before using it to ensure all the models and pure phase components that you do or do not want to use are activated/deactivated appropriately. The convention used for this is to change the spelling of one of the keywords GAS, MINERAL, SOLUTION, or MARGULES so the program skips all following lines until it finds a correctly spelled keyword. Keywords are recognized by at least three * at the beginning of a line.

## Changes/Updates

### 2023-11-23: td-ds62-ef21-v03.txt
There was an error in the site mixing for one of the phase components of the CHL model. This has been corrected and td-ds62-ef21-v02.txt was replaced by td-ds62-ef21-v03.txt.
